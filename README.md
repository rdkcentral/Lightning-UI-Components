# Lightning UI

This library contains shared Lightning components, you can view our live [Storybook documentation](https://github.comcast.com/pages/Lightning/lightning-ui/) to learn more about each component and how to leverage them in your application.

In order to facilitate the development process for our theming architecture we have converted this project into a monorepo using Yarn workspaces. This allows engineers to work across multiple packages without the need for `npm link` or `yarn link`. This also has some other benefits including easy visibility across different @lightning/ui packages, standardization, and better release management.

Three packages are currently maintained and released from this project.

- @lightning/ui
- @lightning/ui-core
- @lightning/ui-extensions

## Peer dependencies

`@lightning/ui` has a peer dependency on `@lightningjs/core^2.x`. If you are stuck using the _old Lightning_, i.e. `wpe-lightning^1.x`, you will need to alias `@lightningjs/core` in your build process. If you are bundling your app using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), you should add this to your config:

```js
// in webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@lightningjs/core': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/wpe-lightning')
    }
  }
};
```

> **NOTE:** aliasing `@lightningjs/core` to point to `wpe-lightning` is _not_ guaranteed to work with everything! Consider updating your Lightning library as soon as possible.

## Installation

`@lightning/ui` is published internally to [Artifactory](https://comcastcorp.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtifEnterprise/SitePages/Knowl.aspx). To install this package, add the following to your local `~/.npmrc` or `your-repo/.npmrc`

```
@lightning:registry=https://artifactory.comcast.com/artifactory/api/npm/Lightning-npm/
@suite-themes:registry=https://artifactory.comcast.com/artifactory/api/npm/xds-npm
```

`@lightning/ui` has a peer dependency on the [Lightning package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lightningjs/core)

```sh
npm install -S @lightning/ui @lightningjs/core
```

## Usage

You should import components using ES6 named imports, like so:

```js
// App.js
import lng from '@lightningjs/core';
import { Button } from '@lightning/ui';
```

You should NOT use path imports like this:

```js
// Do not use
import Button from '@lightning/ui/components/Button';
```

Since packages are now bundled with rollup this allows proper tree shaking behavior. For more information on tree shaking the `@material/ui` documentation has a great guide on [development bundle size](https://material-ui.com/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/) (**note**: this is external documentation otherwise unrelated to this project!).
