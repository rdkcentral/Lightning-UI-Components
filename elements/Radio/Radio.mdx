# Radio

A radio has 2 states: "on" or "off". When used in a group, it should let a user select only one of the choices at a time. This can be managed with the withSelections mixin

## Usage

Simple component that just needs a type.

```js
import { Radio } from '@lightningjs/ui-components';

class Example extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      Radio: {
        type: Radio
      }
    };
  }
}
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="elements-radio--basic" />
</Canvas>
