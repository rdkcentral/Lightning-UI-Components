# Announcer

Extend your app with the `Announcer` class to add a framework for Voice Guidance. On Focus Change events, the `Announcer` class traverses the `_focusPath` property collecting strings or promises of strings to announce to the user. The array of information is passed to a speak function which is responsible for converting the text to speech. We include a default speak function
which uses the [speechSynthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis), but you replace this with your own implementation by passing a speak function as the second argument to `Announcer`

## Usage

Extend your application with `Announcer` before boot:

```js
import { Announcer } from '@lightning/ui'
const Base = Announcer(lng.Component, customSpeechImpl)
export default class App extends Base {
```

Set `announcerEnabled` to true in your app and optionally `debug` to true to see console tables of the output as shown below.

| Index | Component | Property | Value |
| --- | ---- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 0 | BrowsePage-1 | Title | Free to Me
| 1 | Grid | Title |
| 2 | Rows | Title |
| 3 | Row | Title | Popular Movies - Free to Me
| 4 | Items | Title |
| 5 | TileItem | Title | Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows
| 6 | Metadata | Announce | Promise
| 7 | Metadata | No Context |
| 8 | TileItem | Context | 1 of 5
| 9 | Items | No Context |
| 10 | Row | No Context |
| 11 | Rows | No Context |
| 12 | Grid | No Context |
| 13 | BrowsePage-1 | Context |  PAUSE-2 Press LEFT or RIGHT to

The `Announcer` will travel through the `_focusPath` looking for `component.announce` then `component.title` then `component.label` properties. After collecting those properties it reverses the `_focusPath` looking for `component.announceContext` properties.

All of the properties may return a string or recursively nestable array containing strings. Promises for strings and arrays may be used as well for async data.
```js
  get announce() {
    return [
      'Despicable Me',
      Promise.resolve([
        ['2020', 'Rated PG'],
        Promise.resolve('Steve Carell, Miranda Cosgrove, Kristen Wiig, Pierre Coffin')
      ])
    ];
  }

  get announceContext() {
    return 'Press LEFT or RIGHT to review items';
  }
```

You may also use `PAUSE-#` to pause speech for # seconds before saying the next string.
```js
  get announceContext() {
    return ['PAUSE-2.5', 'Hello there!'];
  }
```
