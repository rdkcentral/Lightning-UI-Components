# Sub Theming

## What is Sub Theming?

Sub theming is an aspect of [theming](../?path=/story/docs-theming-overview--page).
It allows for updates/changes to an existing theme without permanently changing that theme.
Essentially, with sub theming, we can create multiple variations of an existing theme to be used across different elements/components.

## Use Case

There are certain cases where we may need all the children of a Lightning element or component to have slightly different theme values.
For example, a special browse page of 4th of July movies or perhaps a Shark Week promotion section.
Distinct color palettes are used to reflect these special occasions but it's not
always the case that we want to have completely new brand (new radius, spacing, etc) values for the pages reflecting these themes.
This is where sub theming comes in.

Sub theming allows us to target certain properities of a theme to change while still keeping the values of the other theme properties.
For example, we can create a sub-theme of the main theme where we change the core colors to reflect that of Shark Week with its
variations of blues and add that to an element like `ProgressBar`.
In this example, the `ProgressBar`'s color would reflect the new blue values from the sub-theme.
However, its radius values would still reflect those of the main theme.
Additionally, `ProgressBar` components used outside the context of this sub-theme will continue to use the brand colors of the main theme.

Likewise, if there are multiple elements to a page, we can set a certain element to have a sub-theme (a contentTray with the Shark Week sub-theme)
while the other elements (a display of tiles) have the main theme.
This allows the user to have two unique experiences living in the same visual space.

## Steps to Utilizing a Sub-Theme

### 1. Set the theme

A sub-theme can't exist without a parent theme thus we first need to specify which theme our component(s) should be using.

Refer to [theming](../?path=/story/docs-theming-overview--page) for how to set the theme.

> Reminder that without a specified theme, the Base open-source theme will be used by default.

### 2. Set the sub-theme

To create a sub-theme, we'll need to utilize `context` and its `setSubTheme` method.
The method takes in the sub-theme name followed by the properties and values of the sub-theme as parameters.

For example, let's imagine we'd like some components to reflect the 4th of July holiday.
Our `setSubTheme` method might look something like:

```js
context.setSubTheme('4thOfJuly', {
  colors: {
    coreNeutral: ['#BF4146', 100], // red
    coreNeutralSecondary: ['#FAF2E6', 85], // white
    coreNeutralTertiary: ['#80A1C2', 85] // blue
  },
  componentStyles: {
    MetadataTile: {
      descriptionTextProperties: {
        textColor: ['#FAF2E6', 85]
      }
    }
  }
})
```
Here we're changing the colors of the existing theme, specifically the `coreNeutral` values and the `textColor` of the `Tile`'s description text, to reflect that of the holiday.

### 3. Apply the sub-theme to the components in need

After creating our sub-theme, we need to specify which components will be utilizing the sub-theme.
Once the components have been picked out, there are two methods to applying the sub-theme.

#### Method 1: Lightning Element

The first method is by utilizing the `_template` function and returning a component with the specified sub-theme.

For example, let's say we have a page of movie `Tiles` and it's getting closer to the 4th of July holiday so we want to have a section displaying 4th of July movies.
In this case, we can create a `_template` function like this:

```js
static _template() {
  return {
    ContentTiles: {
      type: Column,
      itemSpacing: 60,
      items: [
        {
          subTheme: '4thOfJuly',
          type: Row,
          autoResizeHeight: true,
          items: featuredTilesArray
        },
        {
          type: Row,
          autoResizeHeight: true,
          items: baseTilesArray
        }
      ]
    }
  };
}
```

Here we have two `Row` components each containing a set amount of movie `Tiles`.
The first `Row` features the 4th of July movies so the '4thOfJuly' `subTheme` with its red, white, and blue values has been applied to it.
On the other hand, the second `Row` will only reflect the main theme. The following should be displayed:

<img src={SubThemingExample} alt="Row of Tiles with '4thOfJuly' subTheme and a Row with main theme" width="700" />

#### Method 2: `subTheme` Getter Method

Another way to apply the sub-theme is by using a `subTheme` getter method that returns the name of the sub-theme to be used.
> **Note:** This will also apply the sub-theme to all LUI components that are children of this component.

For example, let's focus on the `ProgressBar` component. We can include this:

```js
get subTheme() {
  return '4thOfJuly'
}
```

Assuming we are generating a `ProgressBar` component, our resulting `ProgressBar` should display:

<img src={July4thProgressBar} alt="Progress Bar with the 4th of July sub-theme" width="600" />

The `ProgressBar` uses both `coreNeutral` and `coreNeutralTertiary` to define its `progressColor`
and `barColor`, respectively. Since our '4thOfJuly' sub-theme updated those values, we see the `progressColor`
and `barColor` of the `ProgressBar` reflecting the values set in the sub-theme.

This `ProgressBar` is built off the Base open-source theme. Because the radius was never set, the `ProgressBar`
still continues to reflect the radius value of the Base theme which is set to 0.

> **Note:** Adding the `subTheme` getter method will apply the sub-theme globally to all the listed components inside the `_template` function
> that do not have an assigned sub-theme.
> As in, if another `ProgressBar` were to be added to the `_template` function, it would have the '4thOfJuly' sub-theme if the `subTheme` property was not applied to it.
> Otherwise, if it does have a `subTheme` applied, ie 'sharkWeek', then the 'sharkWeek' sub-theme will overwrite the globally set '4thOfJuly' sub-theme.

## How Does it Work?

Now that we understand how to create and use a sub-theme, let's digest how the component is able to determine how to retrieve the sub-theme.
This all lies in the `_getSubTheme` method.

The `_getSubTheme` method is executed on the `_setup` lifecycle event.
In this function (displayed below), we can see that each component continuously goes through its
parents to check if a sub-theme is applied to that component until there are no more parent components left to check.


```js
_getSubTheme() {
  let parent = this.p;
  while (parent && !parent.subTheme) {
    parent = parent.parent;
  }
  return (parent && parent.subTheme) || undefined;
}
```

As soon as a parent component detects a sub-theme, `_getSubTheme` exits the loop and returns the sub-theme.
If the highest parent component up the chain is reached without returning/discovering a sub-theme, then the component will use the global theme.

> **Important:** If the parent theme is updated, the system will clear the cache the sub-themes depend on, regenerating the sub-theme, and ultimately updating the child elements that rely on the sub-theme.

## Other Useful Methods for Sub Theming

Close to the functionality of the global theme, `context` also has `updateSubTheme` and `removeSubTheme` methods available.
In addition, it has a `setSubThemes` method which is used to generate multiple sub-themes at once.

### updateSubTheme

Similar to the Lightning `patch` object, `updateSubTheme` will only overwrite the properties specified and will not affect any other values from the existing sub-theme.
For example:

```js
context.updateSubTheme('4thOfJuly', {
  colors: {
    coreNeutral: ['#FAF2E6', 85],
  }
})
```

Here, we updated the `coreNeutral` value to white, which will then update the `ProgressBar`'s `progressColor`.
This will only affect the `ProgressBar` to which we have applied the sub-theme. All other colors, like `barColor` will remain unchanged.

<img src={UpdatedJuly4thProgressBar} alt="Progress Bar with the 4th of July sub-theme" width="600" />


### removeSubTheme

The `removeSubTheme` method helps to free up memory when a sub-theme is no longer needed. This can be especially important for devices with limited resources.

```js
context.removeSubTheme('4thOfJuly')
```

### setSubThemes

The `setSubThemes` method can be used to create multiple sub-themes at once by taking in a `subThemes` object. The keys of the object reflect the name of the sub-theme.

The example below will create both a sub-theme reflecting the 4th of July colors as well as a sub-theme reflecting colors
for Shark Week.

```js
context.setSubThemes({
  '4thOfJuly': {
    colors: {
      coreNeutral: ['#BF4146', 100], // red
      coreNeutralSecondary: ['#FAF2E6', 85], // white
      coreNeutralTertiary: ['#80A1C2', 85] // blue
    }
  },
  'sharkWeek': {
    colors: {
      coreNeutral: ['#0078F0', 85],
      coreNeutralSecondary: ['#A9ABAB', 24],
      coreNeutralTertiary: ['#05C5FF', 27]
    }
  }
})
```

The sub-themes can be applied using the 'Lightning Element' method described in step 3 of 'Steps to Utilizing a Sub-Theme.'

```js
static _template() {
  return {
    July4thProgressBar: {
      subTheme: '4thOfJuly',
      ProgressBar: {
        type: ProgressBar,
        progress: 0.5,
        w: 600
      }
    },
    SharkWeekProgressBar: {
      subTheme: 'sharkWeek',
      ProgressBar: {
        y: 100,
        type: ProgressBar,
        progress: 0.5,
        w: 600
      }
    }
  };
}
```

The above code will render two `ProgressBar` components, each utilizing a different sub-theme, as shown below.

<img src={MultiSubThemeProgressBars} alt="Two Progress Bars using the 4th of July sub-theme and Shark Week sub-theme, respectively" width="600" />

>**Note:** Utilizing `setSubThemes` is a convenient way to add multiple sub-themes at one time.
>It does not provide any performance enhancements over using `setSubTheme` for each individual sub-theme.
