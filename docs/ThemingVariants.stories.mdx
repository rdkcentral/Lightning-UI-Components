# Variants
Each Lightning-UI component can be displayed in one of three visual modes that are called variants. 
All components have three variants: **neutral**, **brand**, and **inverse**. Each component has a default variant. 
For example, Xfinity buttons and ListItems default to the neutral variant. 
A component's variant can be set at the theme or component level. 

### Theme level
Each theme may contain a property `componentVariants`. This property can hold one or more properties which correspond to each LUI component's `__componentName`.
You may change the default variant across all LUI components by setting this value in your themes file.
If you want to use a neutral variant on all ProgressBar components in the Xfinity theme you would do this:

```js
componentVariants: {
  ProgressBar: 'neutral'
}
``` 
The resulting theme object would look like this: 

```js
//Inside of themes/Xfinity/index.js
export default{
  colors,
  layout, 
  spacing, 
  getFocusScale,
  getUnfocusScale,
  radius, 
  typography, 
  animations,
  componentStyles:{},
  componentVariants:{
    ProgresBar: 'neutral'
  }
};
```

In this example, **all** ProgressBars will be using the neutral variant. 

### Component level

You may also update this value on a per component basis by setting its variant property. For example: 

```js
MyComponent: {
  type: ProgressBar,
  variant: 'inverse'
}
```
In this example, **only** MyComponent's ProgressBar will use the inverse variant.
