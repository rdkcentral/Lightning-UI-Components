# @lightningjs/ui-components-test-utils

The `@lightningjs/ui-components-test-utils` package provides 2 artifacts to assist with unit testing Lightning components.
1. **Test Renderer**
  - [create](/story/unit-testing-test-renderer-create--page): Generates a `testRenderer` object with built in utilities for unit testing Lightning Components.
  - [toJSON](/story/unit-testing-test-renderer-tojson--page): Converts Lightning components to JSON to be used in [Jest Snapshot Tests](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing)
2. **Test Utils**
  - [makeCreateComponent](/story/unit-testing-test-utils-makecreatecomponent--page): Returns a `createComponent` function which is used to generate an instance of a component to run unit test cases against.
  - [completeAnimation](/story/unit-testing-test-utils-completeanimation--page): Returns a Promise that resolves once all animating properties have updated to their target value(s).
  - [fastForward](/story/unit-testing-test-utils-fastforward--page): Force all running Lightning Transitions on one or more Lightning Elements to finish and update the transitioning property to its target value immediately.
  - [nextTick](/story/unit-testing-test-utils-nexttick--page): Creates a Promise that resolves after a defined amount of time. If no amount of time is specified, the Promise will resolve immediately.
