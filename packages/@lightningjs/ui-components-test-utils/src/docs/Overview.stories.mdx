# @lightningjs/ui-components-test-utils

The `@lightningjs/ui-components-test-utils` package provides 2 artifacts to assist with unit testing Lightning components.
1. **Test Renderer**
  - [create](/story/docs-unit-testing-test-renderer-create--page): Generates a `testRenderer` object with built in utilities for unit testing Lightning Components.
  - [toJSON](/story/docs-unit-testing-test-renderer-tojson--page): Converts Lightning components to JSON to be used in [Jest Snapshot Tests](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing)
2. **Test Utils**
  - [makeCreateComponent](/story/docs-unit-testing-test-utils-makecreatecomponent--page): Returns a `createComponent` function which is used to generate an instance of a component to run unit test cases against.
  - [completeAnimation](/story/docs-unit-testing-test-utils-completeanimation--page): Returns a Promise that resolves once all animating properties have updated to their target value(s).
  - [fastForward](/story/docs-unit-testing-test-utils-fastforward--page): Force all running Lightning Transitions on one or more Lightning Elements to finish and update the transitioning property to its target value immediately.
  - [nextTick](/story/docs-unit-testing-test-utils-nexttick--page): Creates a Promise that resolves after a defined amount of time. If no amount of time is specified, the Promise will resolve immediately.


## Getting Started
All artifacts within `@lightningjs/ui-components-test-utils` are currently only available using ES Module syntax. This differs from the CommonJS syntax Jest is written in.
Due to this, the `@lightningjs/ui-components-test-utils` must be converted to CommonJS via the Jest config setting [transformIgnorePatterns](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transformignorepatterns-arraystring).

By default, the Jest jsdom environment does not provide mocks for canvas and WebGL. A recommended solution for this is to add [jest-webgl-canvas-mock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-webgl-canvas-mock) to the [setupFiles](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#setupfiles-array) option in your Jest config. 

```js
// jest.config.js

const config = {
  // ...other Jest config properties
  setupFiles: ["jest-webgl-canvas-mock"],
  transformIgnorePatterns: [
    "/node_modules/(?!(@lightningjs/ui-components-test-utils)/)",
  ]
  // ...other Jest config properties
}

export default config
```
