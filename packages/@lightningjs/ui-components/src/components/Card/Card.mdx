<Title />

Cards are very configurable. Cards is the foundational basis for all other card variations.

## Source

## Usage

Cards work by providing many of the relevant properties from TextBox, Surface, and Tile.

```js
import { Card } from '@lightningjs/ui-components';

class Basic extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      Card: {
        type: Card,
        title: 'Card'
      }
    };
  }
}
```
