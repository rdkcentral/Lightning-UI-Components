<Title />

An extension of the Button component that represents an individual key on a keyboard

## Source

https://github.com/rdkcentral/Lightning-UI-Components/blob/develop/packages/@lightningjs/ui-components/src/components/Key/Key.js

## Usage

The Key component takes in a title or icon which can be automatically pushed to the Keyboard component's input field.

```js
import { Key } from '@lightningjs/ui-components';

class Basic extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      Key: {
        type: Key
      }
    };
  }
}
```

### Sizing

There are two options for setting the width of a `Key`: dynamically based of the `baseWidth` and `sizes` style properties, or setting a fixed width manually.

For dynamic sizing, the width of the smallest `Key` is defined as the `baseWidth` style property. Then, by setting the `size` property, the `Key` width will increase by multiples of that `baseWdith` (plus the spacing between `Key` components on a `Keyboard`, defined by the `keySpacing` property).

For fixed sizing, set the `fixed` property to `true` and define the `w` property.

| ---------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fixed      | boolean  | false    | false     | when true, `w` overrides dynamically calclulated width                                                                                                                                                                |
| icon       | string   | false    | null      | url for icon                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| onEnter    | function | false    | undefined | if defined, will be invoked when enter is pressed while focused on the `Key` component. When defined, the `$onSoftKey` and `$toggleKeyboard` events will not be emitted from the key (see Events section below)       |
| size       | string   | false    | sm        | width of the Key                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| toggle     | boolean  | false    | undefined | If true, pressing the key will trigger the $toggleKeyboard event. If false, the key will trigger the $onSoftKey event                                                                                                 |
| keySpacing | number   | false    | 0         | The horizontal spacing between each key in a [Keyboard](?path=/docs/components-keyboard--docs). This value is factored into the width of the key so that it aligns with with the borders of other keys in a Keyboard. |

### Style Properties

| name       | type             | description                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| baseWidth  | number           | The base width of a key. This value will be multiplied based on the `size` property of the key                           |
| iconWidth  | number           | width set to all icons                                                                                                   |

| minWidth   | number           | used as a fallback width if no width is passed into the component and `fixed` is false                                   |
| paddingX   | number           | space between the button horizontal edge and the content                                                                 |
| sizes      | object           | used to determine the width of key, contains the properties `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`. See Sizing section for more details. |
| textStyle  | string \| object | text style to apply to the title                                                                                         |

### Events

#### `$onSoftKey({ key: string, toggle: boolean })`

Fired when the enter key is pressed while focused on a `Key` component. An event will be emitted
via Lightning's `fireAncestors` with an object of the `Key`'s `title` and `toggle` property values.
If a funciton is passed to the `Key`'s `onEnter` property, that function will be invoked and the
`$onSoftKey` event will not be emitted.

#### `$toggleKeyboard({ key: string, toggle: boolean })`

Fired when the enter key is pressed while focused on a `Key` component with its `toggle` property
set to `true`. If a funciton is passed to the `Key`'s `onEnter` property, that function will be invoked and the
`$toggleKeyboard` event will not be emitted.
