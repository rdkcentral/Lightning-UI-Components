# Tone

Each Lightning-UI component can be displayed in one of three visual modes that are referred to as a tone. All components have three tone options by default: **neutral**, **brand**, and **inverse**.
Some components can also utilize status colors, like **positive**, **negative**, **caution**, and **info**.

Each component has a default tone. For example, Base theme `Buttons` and `ListItems` default to the neutral tone.

A component's tone can be set at the theme or component level. It is also possible to add custom tones.

### Theme Level

You may change the default tone across all LUI components by setting this value in your theme file's `componentConfig`. For a deeper dive on `tones`, see ["Component Config"](../?path=/docs/docs-theming-component-config--page).

For example, if you want to use a brand tone on all `ProgressBar` components, add ProgressBar's tone to `componentConfig`:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
componentConfig: {
  ProgressBar: {
    tone: 'brand'
  }
}
```

The resulting theme object would look like this:

```js
// Inside of themes/base/index.js
export default {
  color,
  layout,
  spacing,
  radius,
  typography,
  animation,
  componentConfig: {
    ProgressBar: {
      tone: 'neutral'
    }
  }
};
```

In this example, **all** `ProgressBar` components will be using the neutral tone.

### Component Level

You may also update this value on a per component basis by setting its tone property. For example:

```js
MyComponent: {
  type: ProgressBar,
  tone: 'inverse'
}
```

In this example, **only** MyComponent's `ProgressBar` will use the inverse tone.
