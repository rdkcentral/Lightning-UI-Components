# Theming Hierarchy

The above flowchart serves to demonstrate how the different theming-related concepts covered in previous documentation come together to build the final styles for each component.

## Component Style File

A component's style file can consist of a base style object, a [tone style object](path=/docs/docs-theming-tone--page), and a [mode style object](path=/docs/docs-theming-mode--page). These three objects are deep merged, in that order, to create a single style object that serves as the foundation for the final component style object.

## Theme's _componentConfig_

Themes can have a `componentConfig` object that has nested component style objects, which serve to override any styles from component style files. The objects nested within `componentConfig` must have keys matching the `__componentName` of the target components. These are deep merged with the results from each of those files.

## In-line Component Style Overrides

When utilizing components within your application, you can use [withThemeStyles](path=/docs/utilities-withthemestyles--with-theme-styles) to override particular style values in just that use case. Those custom styles are deep-merged with the resulting object from the previous steps.

## Extensions

Any extensions that target a component will be applied after the in-line component style overrides. This creates the final style object which will be referenced by the component via `this.style`.
