# TypeScript and @lightningjs/ui-components

As of version 5.0, @lightningjs/ui-components ships with class definitions for all components. These definitions provide types for all public methods and properties. We're currently working to add support for `SignalMaps` as well as both app and component-level `FireAncestors` definitions. Leveraging these types should be as simple as installing the @lightningjs/ui-components package in any TypeScript project and developing as usual.

The only special setup required at this time is for app-level augmentations, specifically for `FireAncestors`. To configure this there are two paths forward:

1. apply full the @lightningjs/ui-components augmentation following the instructions found here: https://lightningjs.io/docs/#/lightning-core-reference/TypeScript/Augmentation?id=lightningcomponentfireancestorsmap. Ensure the `FireAncestorMaps` in the above example extends @lightningjs/ui-component's types.augmentations.FireAncestorsMap.

2. add the FireAncestorMaps of each component you use to a custom augmentation. Follow the above instructions, however instead of extending the library's FireAncestorsMap, import the components your application uses into the augment and add them to the interface.


We are constantly iterating on these to provide more clear and accurate definitions, so keep up with us in the @lightningjs discord server.
