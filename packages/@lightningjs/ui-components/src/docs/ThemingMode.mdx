# Mode

LightningUI components utilize modes to update `this.style`. The component's appearance can be changed depending on it's mode.

**Common modes include:**

- unfocused (default)
- focused
- disabled
- selected

By default each component will attempt to find a `focused` mode when thte component gains focus.

### Theme Level

You can set any component's default mode by specifying it in the `componentConfig` property of your theme. For a deeper dive on `tones`, see ["Component Config"](../?path=/docs/docs-theming-component-config--page).

```js
componentConfig: {
  Tile: {
    mode: 'focused';
  }
}
```

You can also adjust the functionality of a mode by overriding it in your theme using the `styleConfig` property nested inside `componentConfig`.

```js
componentConfig: {
  Tile: {
    styleConfig: {
      mode: {
        focused: {
          radius: 100;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Component Level

Modes can be set on individual components as well.

In the example below this instance of a Tile would be shown in it's focused state

```js
ModeTest: {
  type: Tile,
  mode: 'focused',
  ...
}
```

Mode styles can also be overwritten using the same overwrite syntax as shown above in the theme overrides

```js
ModeTest: {
  type: Tile,
  style: {
    mode: {
      focused: {
        radius: 100
      }
    }
  }
  ...
}
```
