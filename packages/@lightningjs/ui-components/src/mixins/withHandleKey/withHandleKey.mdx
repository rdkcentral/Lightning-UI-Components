# withHandleKey

The `withHandleKey` mixin can be wrapped around a parent component to handle key events and also to take advantage of the
global `keyMetricsCallbackHandler` in the lightning UI Context.

## Source

https://github.com/rdkcentral/Lightning-UI-Components/blob/develop/packages/@lightningjs/ui-components/src/mixins/withHandleKey/index.js

## Usage

Out of the box, `withHandleKey` adds a generic \_handleKey & \_handleKeyRelease function and calls the corresponding `on{Key}` handler. If no key handler is found, it fires an `$on{Key}` & $on${Key}Release event.

Additionally, if a `metricsPayload` is defined, the global `keyMetricsCallbackHandler` in Context will be invoked with
the given `metricsPayload`.

```js
class Example extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      MyTile: {
        type: Tile,
        onArrowUp: (targetElm, keyEvent) => {
          console.log('Up');
        },
        onArrowDown: (targetElm, keyEvent) => {
          console.log('Down');
        },
        metricsPayload: {
          buttonName: 'arrowUp',
          uniqueId: 'unique-123'
        }
      }
    };
  }

  $onEnter(item, keyEvent) {
    console.log('Child component entered: ', item);
  }
}
```

Take a look at the preview above. Tile component is using the withHandleKey mixin.
If you press enter on the first tile, you should see it print a metrics payload in the console (inspector view)
In this example, Tile extends `withHandleKey` and allows dynamically adding on${Key} functions or event listener for $on{key}.

Example below - an metricPayload is provided, which will be invoked when any key is handled, with the payload
`metricsPayload: { buttonName: 'arrowUp', uniqueId: 'unique-123' }`
