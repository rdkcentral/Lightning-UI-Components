# withTags

The `withTags` mixin can be wrapped around a parent component to have shortcuts for tags created.

## Source

https://github.com/rdkcentral/Lightning-UI-Components/blob/develop/packages/@lightningjs/ui-components/src/mixins/withTags/index.js

## Usage

`withTags` looks for a `static get tags` which returns an array of tags to add getters for.

```js
class Example extends withTags(lng.Component) {
  static _template() {
    return {
      Item: {
        Image: {}
      }
    };
  }

  static get tags() {
    return ['Item', { name: 'Image', path: 'Item.Image' }];
  }
}
```

This example will create two helpers `this._Item` and `this._Image` which will
return `this.tag('Item')` and `this.tag('Item.Image')` repectively.
