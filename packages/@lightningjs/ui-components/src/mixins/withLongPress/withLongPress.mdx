# withLongPress

The `withLongPress` mixin can be wrapped around a parent component to handle key events with a long press to trigger additional behaviors as desired.

## Source

https://github.com/rdkcentral/Lightning-UI-Components/blob/develop/packages/@lightningjs/ui-components/src/mixins/withLongPress/index.js

## Usage

A consumer of this mixin must also supply a threshold property value in milliseconds to the element being wrapped to overwrite the default time of 2000ms.

The threshold property dictates how much time will pass in milliseconds before a secondary behavior gets triggered.

```js
class Example extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      MyTile: {
        type: withLongPress(Tile),
        threshold: 4000
      }
    };
  }

  $longPressHit(keyValue) {
    console.log(`long press detected on key ${keyValue}`);
  }
}
```

Take a look at the preview above. Tile component is using the withLongPress mixin.
If you press any key and hold for the threshold time (2 seconds) on the tile, you should see a text notification that longpress was detected on the given key

### Properties

| name                | type    | required | default | description                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| continuousExecution | boolean | true     | false   | Will allow continuous execution of long press signal, on interval of threshold value, while keypress is held |
| threslhold          | number  | false    | 2000    | Number in milliseconds to indicate how much time should pass during key down to trigger a long press signal  |

### FireAncestors

#### $longPressHit

Fired when a keydown event lasts longer than the threshold value provided (default 2000ms), it supplies the key value of the peypress event as an argument.
