# withEditItems

The `withEditItems` mixin can be wrapped around any component that is or extends a FocusManager to enable rearranging the position of items with an animation

## Source

https://github.com/rdkcentral/Lightning-UI-Components/blob/develop/packages/@lightningjs/ui-components/src/mixins/withEditItems/index.js

## Usage

```js
class Basic extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      TileRow: {
        type: withEditItems(Row),
        items: [
            {
                title: 'item-1'
            },{
                title: 'item-2'
            }, {
                ...
            }... ]
      }
    };
  }

  //Some trigger, in this case a keypress handler to trigger the Tile Row's ability to swap an items position
  _handleEnter() {
      this.tag('TileRow').toggleEdit();
  }
}
```
