# withAnnouncer

Extend your app with the `withAnnouncer` class, that when enabled, allows for relevant information to be voiced along the focus path of the application. On Focus Change events, the `withAnnouncer` class traverses the `_focusPath` property collecting strings or promises of strings to announce to the user. The array of information is passed to a speak function which is responsible for converting the text to speech. We include a default speak function
which uses the [speechSynthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis), but you can replace this with your own implementation by passing a speak function as the second argument to `withAnnouncer`.

Note: The speechSynth api has some known problems:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39391502/js-speechsynthesis-problems-with-the-cancel-method
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23483990/speechsynthesis-api-onend-callback-not-working

This class does its best to work around these issues, but speech synth api can randomly fail.

## Source

https://github.com/rdkcentral/Lightning-UI-Components/blob/develop/packages/@lightningjs/ui-components/src/mixins/withAnnouncer/index.js

## Usage

Extend your application with `withAnnouncer` before boot:

```js
import { withAnnouncer } from '@lightningjs/ui-components';
const Base = withAnnouncer(lng.Application, window.Speech, {
  language: 'en-US'
});
export default class App extends Base {}
```

Set `announcerEnabled` to true in your app and optionally `debug` to true to see console tables of the output as shown below.

| Index | Component    | Property   | Value                                            |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 0     | BrowsePage-1 | Title      | Free to Me                                       |
| 1     | Grid         | Title      |                                                  |
| 2     | Rows         | Title      |                                                  |
| 3     | Row          | Title      | Popular Movies - Free to Me                      |
| 4     | Items        | Title      |                                                  |
| 5     | TileItem     | Title      | Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows |
| 6     | Metadata     | Announce   | Promise                                          |
| 7     | Metadata     | No Context |                                                  |
| 8     | TileItem     | Context    | 1 of 5                                           |
| 9     | Items        | No Context |                                                  |
| 10    | Row          | No Context |                                                  |
| 11    | Rows         | No Context |                                                  |
| 12    | Grid         | No Context |                                                  |
| 13    | BrowsePage-1 | Context    | PAUSE-2 Press LEFT or RIGHT to                   |

The `withAnnouncer` will travel through the `_focusPath` looking for `component.announce` then `component.title` properties. After collecting those properties it reverses the `_focusPath` looking for `component.announceContext` properties.

### SpeechType

All of the properties may return values compatible with the following recursive type definition:

```js
SpeechType = string | Array<SpeechType> | Promise<SpeechType> | () => SpeechType
```

At its simplest, you may return a string or an array of strings. Promises and functions that return SpeechType values may be used as necessary for advanced/asyncronous use cases.

#### Examples

```js
  get announce() {
    return [
      'Despicable Me',
      Promise.resolve([
        ['2020', 'Rated PG'],
        Promise.resolve('Steve Carell, Miranda Cosgrove, Kristen Wiig, Pierre Coffin'),
        () => 'A description of the movie'
      ])
    ];
  }

  get announceContext() {
    return 'Press LEFT or RIGHT to review items';
  }
```

## Inserting a pause

You may also use `PAUSE-#` to pause speech for # seconds before saying the next string.

```js
  get announceContext() {
    return ['PAUSE-2.5', 'Hello there!'];
  }
```

## Translating Abbreviations

Abbreviations in text may be "translated" to their associated phrase via passing an abbreviation configuration object (**abbrevConfig**)
to the options parameter with a key of `abbreviationsConfig`. A default configuration with some common abbreviations is
exported as `defaultAbbrevConfig`.

#### Generating an abbrevaiation configuration object (abbrevConfig)

Pass an array of objects, each with a **pattern** and **replacer** key to the exported function `generateAbbrevConfig`.
The fields in each object in the array passed to `generateAbbrevConfig` are as follows:
**• pattern** - a string or RegExp pattern to match an abbreviation. RegExp patterns must not include any flags and not be wrapped with word boundries (\b).
Within `generateAbbrevConfig` all patterns will be wrapped in word boundaries and use the RegExp global flag.
**• replacer** - a string or RegExp replacer function to replace the matched abbreviation with.
Below is the array used to generate `defaultAbbrevConfig`.

```js
const defaultAbbreviations = [
  { pattern: 'TV-14', replacer: 'Rated TV-14' },
  { pattern: 'CC', replacer: 'Closed Captions available' },
  { pattern: 'HD', replacer: 'High Definition available' },
  { pattern: /ENG(?!\+)/, replacer: 'English Available' },
  { pattern: /ENG\+ES/, replacer: 'Available in English and Spanish' },
  { pattern: 'AD', replacer: 'Audio Description available' },
  { pattern: 'RT', replacer: 'Rotten Tomatoes' },
  {
    pattern: /(S)+(\d+)+(E)+(\d+)+/,
    replacer: (match, p1, p2, p3, p4) => `Season ${p2} Episode ${p4}`
  }
];
const defaultAbbrevConfig = generateAbbrevConfig(defaultAbbreviations);
```

To extend the `defaultAbbrevConfig` with custom configurations, pass `true` as the second parameter to `generateAbbrevConfig`

```js
const customAbbreviations = [{ pattern: 'PA', replacer: 'Pennsylvania' }];
const customAbbrevConfig = generateAbbrevConfig(customAbbreviations, true);

// usage with withAnnouncer
const CustomComp = withAnnouncer(lng.Component, customSpeechImpl, {
  abbreviationsConfig: customAbbrevConfig
});
```
