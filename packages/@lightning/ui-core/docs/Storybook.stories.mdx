### useArgs

There may be cases throughout our Stories where we want one control to affect the value of another control, or a user interaction with the component to update the value of a control.

This can be achieved through Storybook's `useArgs` hook and `updateArgs` method. For more information, check out the documentation [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/addons/addons-api#useargs).

`useArgs` is a hook that is a part of the Storybook API that allows **args** to be read or updated.

Specifically, `useArgs` has a method called `updateArgs` that can be used to update an arg when it changes value.

Below is an example of how to use `updateArgs` along with the value property:

```js
import { useArgs } from '@storybook/client-api';

const [{ value }, updateArgs] = useArgs();

// update arg control when value changes
onChange(value) {
  updateArgs({ value });
}
```

For example, in our [Slider component](../?path=/story/utilities-slider--basic), when in the `focused` mode, if a user hits left or right on their keyboard, the value of the Slider changes accordingly. However, the Storybook control for the current `value` never updates. This puts the component and the control out of sync. The next time the user updates a control, the value will be re-applied, wiping out whatever was set via the keyboard interaction.

To keep the Slider control in sync, we used the `updateArgs` method. In Slider.js, the component emits a signal called "onChange" whenever its value is updated:

```js
this.signal('onChange', this.value, this);
```

In Slider.stories.js, our component intercepts the signal:

```js
Slider: {
  type: Slider,
  value: value,
  signals: {
    onChange: true
  }
}
```

That signal gets mapped to a new method local to our story that then calls the `updateArgs` method

```js
onChange(value) {
  updateArgs({ value });
}
```

This `updateArgs` method is what then updates the value control in Storybook to match the value of the component (the one set by the user when hitting left and right).
