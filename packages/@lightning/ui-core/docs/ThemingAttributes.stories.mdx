## Typography

Theme typography is set up to use semantically-named tokens. They are JavaScript objects, with keys for different font attributes and positioning.

## Animations

Theme animations are stringified functions used to generate curves to be used within components who need animations. These are also tokenized to assist with ensuring consistent behavior between components.

## Colors

Theme colors are set up using semantically-named tokens, which are then used within each component's styles file. Changing the value of one of these tokens propagates that change to all instances where the token is used.
These tokens are set up to take an array of two values: the first is the six character hex code for the color; the second is the alpha value, ranging from 0 to 100. For example:

```js

fillNeutral = ['#ffffff', 95];
```
