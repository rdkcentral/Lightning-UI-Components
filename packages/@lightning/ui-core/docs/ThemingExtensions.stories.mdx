# Extensions

## What are Extensions?

The component library cannot account for every design imaginable. That's where extensions come in.
Extensions are exported functions that return a class.
They allow users to add functionality to components without having to make the components from scratch themselves.

For example, let's say a `Tile` element needs to have a certain feature.
An extension containing that feature can be created and added to the `Tile` element without the developer having to make an entirely new component.

Overall, extensions make LUI as flexible with [theming](../?path=/story/docs-theming-overview--page) as possible.

### `withExtensions` Mixin

Extensions follow a similar structure as mixins. Mixins return classes with added functionality without needing to create a new, standalone class that inherits from another.
They make it so that functions that are often used can be quickly applied across components just by nesting the component in a mixin.
In this way, mixins also simplify the amount of code in the component(s).

The `withExtensions` mixin, specifically, contains functions that allow for the use of extensions in every component.
In order to take advantage of the ability to use extensions, components must have the `withExtensions` mixin applied to it.

> **Note:** All LUI components already have the `withExtensions` mixin applied.

The example below shows how the `withExtensions` mixin is used on the `ProgressBar` component.

```js
export default withExtensions(ProgressBar)
```

> To reiterate, extensions are a way to modify any component at runtime using ES6 class inheritance patterns and apply that change easily across your entire application.

## How to Apply an Extension

### 1. Create the extension

For instance:

```js
export default function textAdditionExtension(Base) {
  return class extends Base {
    _update() {
      this.patch({
        ExtensionAdded: {
          type: TextBox,
          content: 'Extension Applied!',
          style: {
            offsetY: 50
          }
        }
      });
      super._update();
    }
  };
}
```

This example code extension will add a text box displaying 'Extension Applied!' to all the components the extension is applied to.

### 2. Determine which theme(s) and component(s) to apply the extension to

Now that we have the extension defined, we can apply the extension to components in our desired theme(s).
We'll have to generate an array of objects containing the component(s) we want to add the extension to as well as the extension itself.

Let's say we have a theme called 'customTheme' and we want to apply our newly created extension, `textAdditionExtension`, to the `ProgressBar` component.
Our theme file where we define all our theme properties might look something like:

##### ./customTheme/index.js
```js
import textAdditionExtension from '../../extensions/textAddition.extension';

export default {
  name: 'customTheme',
  ...
  extension: [
    {
      targetComponent: ['ProgressBar'],
      extension: textAdditionExtension
    }
  ]
};
```

> Note: Extensions can be written in a file on its own.
> In doing so, you would just need to export the array and import the file into the theme rather than the specific extension displayed above.

### 3. Make sure to call `context.setTheme()` or `context.updateTheme()`

Although we've added the extension to our theme, it isn't truly applied until we set the theme that has our extension or call `updateTheme` on the extension property.

That is, we must call:

```js
context.setTheme(customTheme);
```

or

```js
context.updateTheme({ extensions: textAdditionExtension });
```

After doing all three steps, for our example, we should see a `ProgressBar` with text below it saying 'Extension Applied!' as displayed below:

<img src={ExtensionProgressBar} alt="Progress Bar with 'Extension Applied!' text below" width="600" />

## Use Cases Outside of UI Enhancements

There are many use cases for extensions since it's all about adding functionality to different components.
This provides a fully customizable experience.

Below are some specific examples that extensions can be used for:

### Metrics

Extensions can be used to toggle metrics collection.

For example, let's say we want to collect how often users focus on certain movie `Tiles` to understand the general genre of interest among the audience.
We can write all the functionality of detecting how many times the `Tile` elements are being put into focus state and apply that to the `Tile` components.
As easy as we can apply the extension, we can just as easily remove the extension when we're done with metrics collection.

### A/B Testing

Another potential use of extensions is for A/B testing. If you're unfamiliar with A/B testing, it is also known as 'split testing.'
It's a randomized experiment that explores how users view two or more variations of a component at the same time (often a control - the original and the variation).

For our case, extensions can help us do A/B testing on, say, a new feature of `Tile` or a potential new look to `Tile`.
For example, let's say we want to gauge if making the `Tile` components more vibrant in color would increase engagement.
We can patch an update to the `Tile`'s colors in our extension.
During testing, we can then apply the extension at theme level to random users and test to see if there are more interactions with the vibrant colored `Tile` components.

If we find through A/B testing, the results are not in favor of the vibrant colored `Tile` components, we can easily discard our extension and move forward since we didn't have to touch the core code.

## Things to Keep in Mind

### `super._update()`

If we consider extensions as the child of the existing component it builds off, the `super` keyword allows us to access the properties and methods in the existing/parent component.
`_update` is an extremely important lifecycle event since it ensures everything is up to date.
Together, `super._update()` grants us access to the entire `_update` lifecycle event of the parent component.

For that reason, most often, we would want to include `super._update()` within our extension's `_update` lifecycle event.
This way we ensure our extension functions are applying to the most up to date component.

On the other hand, if we want to update the existing functions within the `_update` lifecycle event in the parent component, then that's when we wouldn't call `super._update()`.

### `_destroy()`

When creating extensions, one important lifecycle event to always include is `_destroy`.
This way we make sure that all the components that use any extensions are able to clean up any unused elements or event listeners if the extension is removed during a theme change at runtime.

An example is provided below, specifically for our `textAdditionExtension`:

```js
_destroy() {
  this.patch({ ExtensionAdded: undefined });
  super._destroy && super._destroy();
}
```

### Order Matters!

Extensions are applied top to bottom. That is, the first extension in the extensions array will be added first, then the second one, and so on.

```js
import { focusRingExtension }  from '../../extensions/FocusRing.extension';
import textAdditionExtension from '../../extensions/textAddition.extension';

export default [
  {
    targetComponent: ['ProgressBar'],
    extension: focusRingExtension
  },
  {
    targetComponent: ['ProgressBar'],
    extension: textAdditionExtension
  }
];
```

In this example, the `focusRingExtension` would be applied to the `ProgressBar` component first and then the `textAdditionExtension` would be applied.
