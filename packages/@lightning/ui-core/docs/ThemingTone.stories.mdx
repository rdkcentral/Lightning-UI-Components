# Tone
Each Lightning-UI component can be displayed in one of three visual modes that are referred to as a tone.
All components have three tone options by default: **neutral**, **brand**, and **inverse**.
Some of our components also utilize status colors, like **positive**, **negative**, **caution**, and **info**.
It is also possible to add other custom tones. Each component has a default tone.
For example, Base theme `Buttons` and `ListItems` default to the neutral tone.
A component's tone can be set at the theme or component level.

### Theme level
Each theme may contain a property `componentTone`. This property can hold one or more properties which correspond to each LUI component's `__componentName`.
You may change the default tone across all LUI components by setting this value in your themes file.
If you want to use a neutral tone on all `ProgressBar` components in the Base or your custom theme you would do this:

```js
componentTone: {
  ProgressBar: 'neutral'
}
```
The resulting theme object would look like this:

```js
// Inside of themes/base/index.js
export default {
  color,
  layout,
  spacing,
  radius,
  typography,
  animation,
  componentStyle: {},
  componentTone: {
    ProgressBar: 'neutral'
  }
};
```

In this example, **all** `ProgressBar` components will be using the neutral tone.

### Component level

You may also update this value on a per component basis by setting its tone property. For example:

```js
MyComponent: {
  type: ProgressBar,
  tone: 'inverse'
}
```
In this example, **only** MyComponent's `ProgressBar` will use the inverse tone.
