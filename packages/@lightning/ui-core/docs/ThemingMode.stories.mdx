# Mode

LightningUI components utilize modes to update `this.style`. The component's appearance can be changed depending on it's mode. 

**Common modes include:**

* unfocused (default)
* focused
* disabled
* selected

By default each component will attempt to find a `focused` mode when thte component gains focus. 

### Theme level

You can set any component's default mode by specifying it in the componentMode property of your theme.

```js
componentMode: {
  Tile: 'focused'
}
``` 

You can also adjust the functionality of a mode by overriding it in your theme using the componentStyle property. To target a mode override select the component to target ex. `ProgressBar` add a mode property to the theme level component overrride.

```js
componentStyle: {
  Tile: {
    mode: {
      focused: {
        radius: 100
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Component level overrides

Modes can be set on individual components as well. 

In the example below this instance of a Tile would be shown in it's focused state

```js
ModeTest: {
  type: Tile,
  mode: 'focused',
  ...
}
```

Mode styles can also be overwritten using the same overwrite syntax as shown above in the theme overrides

```js
ModeTest: {
  type: Tile,
  style: {
    mode: {
      focused: {
        radius: 100
      }
    }
  }
  ...
}
```
