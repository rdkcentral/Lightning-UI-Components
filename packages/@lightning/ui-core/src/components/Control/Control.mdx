# Control

`Control` is a specific type of `Button`, mainly used for Xfinity.

## Source

https://github.comcast.com/Lightning/lightning-ui/blob/develop/packages/@lightning/ui-core/src/components/Control/Control.js

## Usage

Used to convey an interactable portion of the interface, a `Control` can present text (title), an icon, a logo, or both text and an icon or logo.
It has support for focused, unfocused, and disabled states.

```js
import { Control } from '@lightning/ui';

class Example extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      Control: {
        type: Control,
        title: 'Control'
      }
    };
  }
}
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="controls-control--control" />
</Canvas>

All `Control` components support two types of prefixes (Lightning components placed to the left of the title text): an icon or a logo (image/png/jpg).

### Icon

If the `Control` is provided an `icon`, it will be positioned to the left of the title and centered horizontally and vertically.

### Logo

If the `Control` is provided a logo/image, the radius of the image reflects the radius of the Surface component.
That is, if the corner radius of the Surface is 0 then the corner radius of the image is also 0.

### Collapsed Flag

Optional flag for the `Control` element to collapse (hide the title) when `Control` is not in focused mode.
