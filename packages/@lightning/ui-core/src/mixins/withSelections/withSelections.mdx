# withSelections

The `withSelections` mixin can be wrapped around a parent component that holds a list of components with a "selected" state where only one child component may have `isSelected=true` at a time.

## Source

https://github.comcast.com/Lightning/lightning-ui/blob/develop/packages/@lightning/ui-core/src/mixins/withSelections/index.js

## Usage

Out of the box, `withSelections` adds properties and methods to the wrapped parent component that allows it to manage the "selected" status of a direct list of components. All of the method and property names are customizable. In order to ensure that `withSelections` work correctly, we need to understand what this mixin **requires** and what **additions** it brings to the base class.

### Required properties

Let's look at a pseudo-code of the below example:

```js
class UnderlineButton extends Button {
  set isSelected(isSelected) {
    // if isSelected is true render a line through the button
    // else do not render a line through the button
  }
}

class Example extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      Items: {
        type: withSelections(Row),
        items: [
          { type: UnderlineButton, title: 'Left' },
          { type: UnderlineButton, title: 'Center' },
          { type: UnderlineButton, title: 'Right' }
        ]
      }
    };
  }
}
```

Take a look at the preview above. The row of modified [Buttons](?path=/docs/controls-button--button) has navigation managed by the [Row](?path=/docs/navigation-row--row) component, which is also wrapped in `withSelections`. Navigate with the arrow keys to see the `focus` state change for each [Button](?path=/docs/controls-button--button). Hit the `Enter` key to set the currently focused `Button` to be `isSelected`, giving it an underline. Also notice that underline of the previously selected `Button` is removed.

In this example, `withSelections` is expecting the `Row` component to have a property called `items` which contains components that can handle an `isSelected` property. Fortunately, this describes the `Row` and `UnderlineButton` components perfectly! If your components are working with different property names, they can be customized with the `options` property. See the [Customization](#customization) section for options.

### Added properties and methods

Now that it is wrapped with `withSelections`, the `Row` component has access to a few new properties and methods. The `currentSelected` and `currentSelectedIndex` properties point to the child component that is _currently selected_ and the index of that component in the `items` array.

```js
// ex. rendering text of the currently selected item's title
_firstEnable() {
  const selectedItem = this.tag('Items').currentSelected;
  this.tag('Title').text.text = 'Selected: ' + selectedItem.title;
}
```

The core of the management functionality lives in the added `setSelected` method, which will set the `isSelected` value on the given component, then fire the `$onSelect` event via [fireAncestors](https://lightningjs.io/docs/#/lightning-core-reference/Communication/FireAncestors?id=fire-ancestors).
A `_captureKey` method is also added, which calls `setSelected` in response to an `Enter` key event by default. All of these values can be customized; see the [Customization](#customization) section for options.

```js
// this will be called after setting the isSelected property on an item
$onSelect() {/* respond to changes to the selected component */}
```

Lastly, a `fireAncestors` handler is added, in case you need to programmatically trigger the `setSelected` method via a child component.
By default the method that handles this is named `$setSelected`, but can be changed to another value by the `options`.

```js
// trigger the $setSelected method in a parent component that has been passed to withSelections
class ChildComponent extends lng.Component {
  _focus() {
    super._focus();
    this.fireAncestors('$setSelected', this, true);
  }
}
```

### Customization
