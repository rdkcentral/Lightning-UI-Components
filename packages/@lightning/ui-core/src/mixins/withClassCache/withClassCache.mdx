# withClassCache

The `withClassCache` mixin can be wrapped around a class to memoize class creation.

## Source

https://github.comcast.com/Lightning/lightning-ui/blob/develop/packages/@lightning/ui-core/src/mixins/withClassCache/index.js

## Usage

```js
withClassCache(base => class Example extends base {});
```

Returns a new function which takes a base class, and if the class is already created, returns the cached version.
This is very important when using patterns like withMetadata. Ideally you should create a single instance as a const
and reuse that class like so:

```js
//do this
export const myWithMeta = withMetadata(BaseComp);
//or this
const withMetaCache = withClassCache(withMetadata(BaseComp));
type: withMetaCache(BaseComp)

//not this
type: withMetadata(BaseComp)
```

The first two will reuse the class that you've created, the last will cause the browser to create a new class each
time the component is created.
