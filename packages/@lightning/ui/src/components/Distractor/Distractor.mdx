# Distractor

Basic component that handles styling and functionality for a loader component.

## Source

https://github.comcast.com/Lightning/lightning-ui/blob/develop/packages/@lightning/ui/src/components/Distractor/Distractor.js

## Usage

`Distractor` can be used without passing in any additional values and simply toggling the animation via stop and start.

```js
import { Distractor } from '@lightning/ui';

class Example extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      Distractor: {
        type: Distractor
      }
    };
  }
}
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="utilities-distractor--distractor" />
</Canvas>

### Sizing

`Distractor` widths dynamically adjust over the course of the animation. You can set the 'initial' individual circle size via the style property `circleSize`.
