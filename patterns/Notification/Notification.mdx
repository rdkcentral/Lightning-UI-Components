# Notification

This is an Xfinity branded notification. This notification should only be used inside of Xfinity branded apps. However, this notification can show up as an overlay to external apps if required.

## Usage

`Notification` must take in a `title`, `description`, and `icon`. These are the minimum design requirements for a notification. Notification is also able to accept an optional actionArea object that can provide context on how to proceed with the information provided.

Based on the length of the `description`, the notification will dynamically grow its height to accomodate for any extra lines appended to it. The description field utilizes the [InlineContent](?path=/docs/inlinecontent--basic) component so you are able to mix text and icons as the description.

```js
import { Notification } from '@lightning/ui';

class Example extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      Notification: {
        type: Notification,
        icon: 'path/to/icon',
        title: 'Title',
        description: 'This is the description.'
      }
    };
  }
};
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="patterns-notification--basic" />
</Canvas>
