# withHandleKey

The `withHandleKey` mixin can be wrapped around a component to handle key events.


## Usage

Out of the box, `withHandleKey` adds a generic `_handleKey` & `_handleKeyRelease` function and calls the corresponding `on{Key}` handler. If no key handler is found, it fires an `$on{Key}` & `$on${Key}Release` event that parent components can listen for.
Either function will be called with 2 parameters: the component which triggered the key event, and the key event object.

```js
class Child extends lng.Component {
  // Tile template and methods
}

const ChildWithHandleKey = withhandlekey(Child)

class Example extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      Parent: {
        type: ChildWithHandleKey,
        onArrowUp: (targetElm, keyEvent) => {
          console.log('Up');
        },
        onArrowDown: (targetElm, keyEvent) => {
          console.log('Down');
        }
      }
    }
  }

  $onEnter(item, keyEvent) {
    console.log('Child component entered: ', item);
  }
}
```

In this example, `withHandleKey`extends `ChildWithHandleKey` and allows dynamically adding `on${Key}` functions to `ChildWithHandleKey` or event listeners for `$on{key}` to `Parent`(or any other parent component of `ChildWithHandleKey`).
