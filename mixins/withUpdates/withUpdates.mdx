# withUpdates

The `withUpdates` mixin can be wrapped around a parent component to have properties which call an `_update` function.

## Usage

`withUpdates` looks for a `static get properties` which returns an array of properties to add getters and setters for.
You can add a `_get${PropName}(value)` function to override the default return value from the getter. Likewise, you
can add a `_set${PropName}(value)` function which returns a processed value for storing. The setter automatically calls
`_requestUpdate` which in turn calls `_update` in components to render. Additionally, a private property `_${propName}`
is created to store the value, which can be utilized to set initial values.

Important to note that you can not override properties which exist on the component, ie w or h.

```js
class Example extends withUpdates(lng.Component) {
  static get properties() {
    return ['title'];
  }

  _init() {
    this._title = 'Default Title Value';
  }

  _update() {
    this.text = {
      text: this.title
    }
  }
}
```
