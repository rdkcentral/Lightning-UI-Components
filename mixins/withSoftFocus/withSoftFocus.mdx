# withSoftFocus

A `withSoftFocus` mixin, which decorates [`ListItem`](?path=/docs/listitem--basic) with specific marker,
indicating that even when ui focus is lost, marked [`ListItem`](?path=/docs/listitem--basic) is still in *selected* state.

## Source

https://github.comcast.com/Lightning/lightning-ui/packages/@lightning/ui-core/src/components/withSoftFocus/withSoftFocus.js

## Usage

`withSoftFocus` marker is being represented by configurable white dash, attached to the left side of `ListItem` component.

```js
import { withSoftFocus } from '@lightning/ui';
import { ListItem } from '@lightning/ui';

class Example extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      ListItem: {
          type: withSoftFocus(ListItem),
          backgroundType: args.backgroundType,
          title: args.title,
          subtitle: args.subtitle,
          size: args.size,
          softFocused: args.softFocus
        }
    };
  }
};
```

Previews:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mixins-withsoftfocus--basic" />
</Canvas>

Soft Focus Marker will appear only in case ListItem component does not have actual ui focus. There is no need to display

additional markers in case ui focus has already covered current ListItem .
