# withAnnouncer

Extend your app with the `Announcer` class to add a framework for Voice Guidance. On Focus Change events, the `Announcer` class traverses the `_focusPath` property collecting strings or promises of strings to announce to the user. The array of information is passed to a speak function which is responsible for converting the text to speech. We include a default speak function
which uses the [speechSynthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis), but you replace this with your own implementation by passing a speak function as the second argument to `Announcer`

Note: The speechSynth api has some known problems:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39391502/js-speechsynthesis-problems-with-the-cancel-method
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23483990/speechsynthesis-api-onend-callback-not-working

This class does its best to work around these issues, but speech synth api can randomly fail.

## Usage

Extend your application with `Announcer` before boot:

```js
import { withAnnouncer } from '@lightning/ui'
const Base = withAnnouncer(lng.Application, window.Speech, { language: 'en-US'} )
export default class App extends Base {
```

Set `announcerEnabled` to true in your app and optionally `debug` to true to see console tables of the output as shown below.

| Index | Component | Property | Value |
| --- | ---- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 0 | BrowsePage-1 | Title | Free to Me
| 1 | Grid | Title |
| 2 | Rows | Title |
| 3 | Row | Title | Popular Movies - Free to Me
| 4 | Items | Title |
| 5 | TileItem | Title | Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows
| 6 | Metadata | Announce | Promise
| 7 | Metadata | No Context |
| 8 | TileItem | Context | 1 of 5
| 9 | Items | No Context |
| 10 | Row | No Context |
| 11 | Rows | No Context |
| 12 | Grid | No Context |
| 13 | BrowsePage-1 | Context |  PAUSE-2 Press LEFT or RIGHT to

The `Announcer` will travel through the `_focusPath` looking for `component.announce` then `component.title` then `component.label` properties. After collecting those properties it reverses the `_focusPath` looking for `component.announceContext` properties.


### SpeechType
All of the properties may return values compatible with the following recursive type definition:
```
SpeechType = string | Array<SpeechType> | Promise<SpeechType> | () => SpeechType
```
At its simplest, you may return a string or an array of strings. Promises and functions that return SpeechType values may be used as necessary for advanced/asyncronous use cases.

#### Examples
```js
  get announce() {
    return [
      'Despicable Me',
      Promise.resolve([
        ['2020', 'Rated PG'],
        Promise.resolve('Steve Carell, Miranda Cosgrove, Kristen Wiig, Pierre Coffin'),
        () => 'A description of the movie'
      ])
    ];
  }

  get announceContext() {
    return 'Press LEFT or RIGHT to review items';
  }
```

## Inserting a pause

You may also use `PAUSE-#` to pause speech for # seconds before saying the next string.
```js
  get announceContext() {
    return ['PAUSE-2.5', 'Hello there!'];
  }
```

## Translating Abbreviations
Abbreviations in text may be "translated" to their associated phrase via passing an abbreviation configuration object (**abbrevConfig**) 
to the options parameter with a key of `abbreviationsConfig`. A default configuration with some common abbreviations is
exported as `defaultAbbrevConfig`. 

#### Generating an abbrevaiation configuration object (abbrevConfig)
Pass an array of objects, each with a **pattern** and **replacer** key to the exported function `generateAbbrevConfig`.
The fields in each object in the array passed to `generateAbbrevConfig` are as follows:  
**• pattern** - a string or RegExp pattern to match an abbreviation. RegExp patterns must not include any flags and not be wrapped with word boundries (\b). 
Within `generateAbbrevConfig` all patterns will be wrapped in word boundaries and use the RegExp global flag.  
**• replacer** - a string or RegExp replacer function to replace the matched abbreviation with. 
Below is the array used to generate `defaultAbbrevConfig`.

```js
const defaultAbbreviations = [
  { pattern: 'TV-14', replacer: 'Rated TV-14' },
  { pattern: 'CC', replacer: 'Closed Captions available' },
  { pattern: 'HD', replacer: 'High Definition available' },
  { pattern: /ENG(?!\+)/, replacer: 'English Available' },
  { pattern: /ENG\+ES/, replacer: 'Available in English and Spanish' },
  { pattern: 'AD', replacer: 'Audio Description available' },
  { pattern: 'RT', replacer: 'Rotten Tomatoes' },
  {
    pattern: /(S)+(\d+)+(E)+(\d+)+/,
    replacer: (match, p1, p2, p3, p4) => `Season ${p2} Episode ${p4}`
  }
];
const defaultAbbrevConfig = generateAbbrevConfig(defaultAbbreviations);
```

To extend the `defaultAbbrevConfig` with custom configurations, pass `true` as the second parameter to `generateAbbrevConfig`
```js
const customAbbreviations = [
  { pattern: 'PA', replacer: 'Pennsylvania' },
]
const customAbbrevConfig = generateAbbrevConfig(customAbbreviations, true)

// usage with withAnnouncer
const CustomComp = withAnnouncer(lng.Component, customSpeechImpl, { abbreviationsConfig: customAbbrevConfig })
```

## API

### Options

name|type|readonly|default|description
--|--|--|--
voiceOutDelay|integer|false|time in ms to determine when voice out is read.
language|string|false|[BCP 47 Language Code](https://appmakers.dev/bcp-47-language-codes-list/) the SpeechSynthesisAPI should read out the strings in
abbreviationsConfig|object|false|{}|configuration object generated by `generateAbbrevConfig` used to translate abbreviations into words

### Properties

name|type|readonly|description
--|--|--|--
announcerEnabled|boolean|false|flag to turn on our off Announcer
announcerTimeout|number|false|By default the announcer only gets information about what changed between focus paths. The announcerTimeout resets the cache to announce the full focus path when the user has been inactive a certain amount of time. Default value is 5 minutes.


### Signals

name|args|description
--|--|--|--
$announce||Performs a manual announce
&nbsp;|`announcement`|See *SpeechType* above
&nbsp;|`options`|Object containing one or more boolean flags: <br/><ul><li>append - Appends announcement to the currently announcing series.</li><li>notification - Speaks out notification and then performs $announcerRefresh.</li></ul>
$announcerRefresh|depth|Performs an announce using the focusPath - depth can trim known focusPath
$announcerCancel|none|Cancels current speaking

### Hooks

name|args|description
--|--|--|--
focusDiffHook|array|Array of elements that have changed focus

### Events

These stage level events can be listened to using the syntax `this.stage.on('EVENT_NAME', callback);`

name|args|description
--|--|--|--
announceEnded|-|emitted when all contents of the announce array have finished being read out
announceTimoutEnded|-|emitted after the amount of time of announded word count * 500ms, used to account for the known speechSynth api issues above
