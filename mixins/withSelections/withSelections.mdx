# withSelections

The `withSelections` mixin can be wrapped around a parent component that holds a list of components with a "selected" state where only one child component may have `isSelected=true` at a time.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mixins-withselections--basic" />
</Canvas>

Take a look at the preview above. The row of modified [Buttons](?path=/docs/button--basic) has navigation managed by the [FocusManager](?path=/docs/focusmanager--rows) component, which is also wrapped in `withSelections`. Navigate with the arrow keys to see the `focus` state change for each [Button](?path=/docs/button--basic). Hit the `Enter` key to set the currently focused `Button` to be `isSelected`, giving it an underline. Also notice that underline of the previously selected `Button` is removed.

## Usage

Out of the box, `withSelections` adds properties and methods to the wrapped parent component that allows it to manage the "selected" status of a direct list of components. All of the method and property names are customizable. In order to ensure that `withSelections` work correctly, we need to understand what this mixin **requires** and what **additions** it brings to the base class.

### Required properties

Let's look at a pseudo-code of the above example:

```js
class Example extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      Items: {
        type: withSelections(FocusManager),
        direction: 'row',
        items: [{ type: UnderlineButton }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, `withSelections` is expecting the `FocusManager` component to have a property called `items` which contains components that can handle an `isSelected` property. Fortunately, this describes the `FocusManager` and `UnderlineButton` components perfectly! If your components are working with different property names, they can be customized with the options property. See the [Customization](#customization) section for options.

### Added properties and methods

Now that it is wrapped with `withSelections`, the `FocusManager` component now has access to a few new properties and methods. The `currentSelected` and `currentSelectedIndex` properties point to the child component that is _currently selected_.

```js
_firstEnable() {
  this.tag('Title').text.text = 'Selected: ' + this.tag('Items').currentSelected.title
}
```

The core of the management functionality lives in the added `setSelected` method, which will set the `isSelected` value on the given component, then fire the `$onSelect` event. A `_captureKey` method is also added, which calls `setSelected` in response to an `Enter` key event. All of these values can be customized; see [Customization](#customization) for options.

```js
$onSelect() {/* respond to changes to the selected component */}
```

Lastly, a `fireAncestors` handler is added, in case you need to programmatically trigger the `setSelected` method via a child component.

```js
_focus() {
  super._focus();
  this.fireAncestors('$setSelected', this, true);
}
```

### Customization

This section addresses all of the optional properties that can be passed as the second argument to `withSelections`

Here's an overview:

```js
const defaultOpts = {
  captureKey: 'Enter',
  defaultIndex: 0,
  eventName: 'onSelect',
  keys: {
    currentSelected: 'currentSelected',
    currentSelectedIndex: 'currentSelectedIndex',
    isSelected: 'isSelected',
    items: 'items',
    setSelected: 'setSelected',
  },
}
```

#### captureKey

Default value: `'Enter'`. Defines key name(s) to capture in order to set the selected status of the currently focused child component.

```js
withSelections(FocusManager, { captureKey: 'OK' });
withSelections(FocusManager, { captureKey: ['Enter', 'OK']})
```

#### defaultIndex

Default value: `0`. Defines the index of the component that should be `selected` on load.

```js
withSelections(FocusManager, { defaultIndex: 1 })
```

#### eventName

Default value: `'onSelect'`. Defines the name of the event fired via `fireAncestors` by the wrapped component when a `selected` property is changed.

```js
withSelections(FocusManager, { eventName: 'selectChanged' });
```

> **NOTE**: The event fired will prepend a "$" to the event name. In the above example, the event will be `'$selectChanged'`

#### keys.currentSelected

Default value: `'currentSelected'`. Defines the name of the property applied to the wrapped component that refers to the **current selected component**

```js
withSelections(FocusManager, {
  keys: {
    currentSelected: 'current'
  }
});
```

#### keys.currentSelectedIndex

Default value: `'currentSelectedIndex'`. Defines the name of the property applied to the wrapped component that refers to the **index of the current selected component**

```js
withSelections(FocusManager, {
  keys: {
    currentSelectedIndex: 'currentIndex'
  }
});
```

#### keys.isSelected

Default value: `'isSelected'`. Defines the name of the property applied to the child components in `items`.

```js
withSelections(FocusManager, {
  keys: {
    isSelected: 'selected'
  }
});
```

#### keys.items

Default value: `'items'`. Defines the name of the property applied to the wrapped component that refers to the **list of managed child components**

```js
withSelections(FocusManager, {
  keys: {
    items: 'children'
  }
});
```

#### keys.setSelected

Default value: `'setSelected'` Defines the name of the method applied to the wrapped component that manages `isSelected` values for child components in `items`.

```js
withSelections(FocusManager, {
  keys: {
    setSelected: 'setChildSelected'
  }
});
```

> **NOTE**: Lightning has a `select` method on it's `Element` class, so avoid setting `keys.setSelected` to `'select'`, as tempting as it may be...
