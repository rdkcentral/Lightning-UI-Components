# withStyles

Use `withStyles` to create composable components that can be easily themed and decoupled from functionality.

The `withStyles` mixin provides flexibility with _composability_: the concept of combining the properties of multiple components to create a new component. This is not intended to be a replacement for building a component API, but rather an tool for augmentation.

## Usage

Let's use an example to see how we can use `withStyles`. Let's say I have an unstyled `Box` component with a defined width and height:

```js
import lng from '@lightningjs/core';

class Box extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      w: 100,
      h: 100,
      rect: true
    };
  }
}
```

If I want to re-use this `Box` to create a _new_ component called `BlueBox`, I can do that by extending the base class.

```js
class BlueBox extends Box {
  static _template() {
    return {
      ...super._template(),
      color: 0xff0000ff
    };
  }
}
```

In order add to the template, we need to spread `super._template()`, which is fine for a very simple component like `Box`, but can get overwhelming for a more complex component.

We can refactor `Box` to "lift" the styles out of the class declaration using `withStyles`

```js
const styles = {
  w: 100,
  h: 100,
  color: 0
};

class Box extends withStyles(class extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      w: this.styles.w,
      h: this.styles.h,
      color: this.styles.color,
      rect: true
    };
  }
}, styles) {};
```

Now we are starting to lock down the API. My `Box` component is expecting a `w`, `h`, and `color`, which are set via the `styles` object. `withStyles` creates a getter for the `styles` object at both the instance _and_ static level, which is why we can call `this.styles` from `static _template()`.

> **NOTE**: Take a close look at the class definition here:
> `class Box extends withStyles(class extends lng.Component {...}, styles) {}`
> This may seem a little gross, but we are just doing a shorthand here. You could always define a base class outside of `withStyles` and pass it in. Another option would be `class Box extends withStyles(lng.Component, styles) {}`, which seems a lot cleaner, BUT -- this will pollute the `lng.Component` prototype _and_ static class! If you want _every_ Lightning component in your app to inherit `styles` and `theme`, go for it (but we do not recommend this)!

Composing a `BlueBox` becomes much simpler now:

```js
const blueStyles = { color: 0xff0000ff }
class BlueBox extends withStyles(Box, blueStyles) {}
```

My `BlueBox` will maintain the `w` and `h` properties of `Box` because `withStyles` merges the new `styles` object with that of the base class.

> The `styles` object can be any shape you want. There are no hard rules there, but it makes sense to use property names that are representative of their values. The implementation of `styles` values in your class declaration is also up to you. Remember: if you use `withStyles`, you can use it for as little or as many properties as you'd like, although it's recommended to use it for _all_ properties that are part of styling.

With this refactor, my `Box` properties can still be used normally

```js
// works
class Example extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      Box: {
        type: Box,
        w: 150,
        h: 50,
        color: 0xff00ff00
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage with Theme

<Canvas>
  <Story id="mixins-withstyles--with-theme" />
</Canvas>

So far, we have seen `withStyles` implementations using a `styles` object as an argument. Another way to implement `withStyles` is to pass a `styles` function that accepts a `theme` object as an argument. See the [Themes](?path=/docs/styles-themes--page) documentation for more info on theme structure.

```js
const theme = {
  colors: {
    background: 0xff000000,
    text: 0xffffffff
  }
};

const styles = theme => {
  color: theme.colors.background,
  textColor: theme.colors.text
};

class Box extends withStyles(class extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      w: 100,
      h: 100,
      color: this.styles.color,
      rect: true
    }
  }
}, styles, theme) { }

class Text extends withStyles(class extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      text: {
        textColor: this.styles.textColor
      }
    }
  }
}, styles, theme) { }
```

In this arbitrary example, we can see that both `Box` and `Text` are pulling from the same `styles` and using the same `theme`. We can imagine exporting a `theme` object that allows setting stylistic values at a global level, while `styles` objects could be set separately at a component level. In fact, that is exactly what we are doing in @lightningjs/ui-components!
